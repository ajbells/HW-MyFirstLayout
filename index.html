    <p>
      My name is Asante Bells, and Iâ€™m currently seeking an opportunity in UX/UI Design.
      I have a Bachelor's of Science degree in Industrial and Systems Engineer. I decide to pursue further interest in
      UX/UI due to
      my experience as a researcher in my undergraduate career. I spent 18 months in my field as an Industrial Engineer
      and relaized
      that I wanted to be more involved with technology.
